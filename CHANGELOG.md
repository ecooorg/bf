## P118.3.2 — Single version source (package.json) and documentation audit

- Version: `package.json` is the only source. New field `"patch"` (last applied patch, e.g. `118.3.2`); `"version"` must equal its first number. `src/config.ts` derives `APP_VERSION`/`APP_PATCH` from `package.json` (the browser bundle receives only these two fields via a Vite plugin); diagnostics `release` = `patch`.
- `scripts/check-version.mjs` validates `package.json` only; it no longer reads `src/config.ts`, `server.ts` or `CHANGELOG.md`. Tests in `tests/core.test.mjs` rewritten accordingly.
- `scripts/patch-tools.mjs` `versionPreflight` (called by `patch-pack`): `package.json` must be in every patch; patch number must match `--patch`, must be higher than the base patch and not below the program version.
- `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.server.json`: `resolveJsonModule`. `scripts/patch-quality-report.mjs`: version context from `package.json`.
- Documentation audit: `AGENTS.md` (new "Version and patch numbering", status, evidence rule, navigation), `docs/AI-OPERATING-RULES.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md`, `docs/AI-NATIVE-RENOVATION-TASK.md`, `docs/AI-NATIVE-RENOVATION-ROADMAP.md` (P118 exit gate), `docs/AI-USER-VALUE-REPORT.md` (new records, title fixed), `docs/AI-ENVIRONMENT-CONTEXT.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, `NEXT_PATCH.md`.
- Verification (local): `tsc` client+server, `build`, `test:core`, `test:app-builder`, `test:compact-ci-artifacts`, full `ci` DAG. Hosted CI and live workflow NOT_RUN.
- Known limitation: sub-patches share one program version; `/health` reports `version` and `commit` only (patch is in diagnostics `release`).

## P118.3.1 — CI repair for P118.3

- CI run on 1a98a6a was red (4 DAG nodes): `version-consistency`, `typecheck`, `build`, `test:compact-ci-artifacts`.
- Root causes: (1) P118.3 bumped APP_VERSION/package.json to 119 while the release label is P118.3 — `check-version` requires the CHANGELOG major to equal APP_VERSION; version restored to 118. (2) `appBuilder/core-engine.ts`: with `strict:false` TypeScript does not narrow `{ok:true}|{ok:false}` by `!x.ok`; failure fields are now read through `'error' in x` / `'issues' in x`. (3) `test:compact-ci-artifacts` (P105 end-to-end) failed only because it runs `version-consistency`; fixed by (1).
- No behavior change in the Spec repair logic.

## P118.3 — Spec bounded repair + assistant diagnostics

- Live #3: planner returned parseable JSON that failed Spec validation; recovery did not run (only on unparseable).
- Spec stage: explicit `schemaVersion:1`, `parseJsonLenient`, `validateSpec` with issue list, one recovery call that includes previous issues, concrete `failureReason` / `error.detail`.
- Diagnostics: `spec_attempt`/`spec_repair`/`spec_failed` events with text previews; adapter logs model `responsePreview` and forwards event data into application logs.
- Tests: `tests/app-builder-spec-repair-p118.test.mjs`.
- APP_VERSION stays 118 (version = phase number; sub-patches P118.x do not bump it).
